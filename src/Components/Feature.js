            Digital India is a campaign launched by the Government of India in
            order to ensure the Government's services are made available to
            citizens electronically by improved online infrastructure and by
            increasing Internet connectivity or making the country digitally
            empowered in the field of technology.Launched on 1 July 2015, by
            Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is both enabler and
            beneficiary of other key Government of India schemes. <br />
            On the same day, we launched Project Hubnex to give a pace to
            Digital India campaign, under <strong>#ProjectHubnex</strong> we aim
            to digitalise small and medium enterprise in India, enabling them to
            unleash their full potential and giving them impeccable digital
            presence. We have helped many small scale traders, shops, artisans,
            tribals etc. by setting up their e-commerce portals/online channels
            which can expose them to a bigger global market. We have been
            helping the MSME's &amp; Small Businesses to go online to fuel the
            motive of Digital india‚Äù.
